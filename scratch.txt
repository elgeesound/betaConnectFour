Each player has a'turn'. (alternating) ie blue then red.
On a row click that triggers a handler that 'inserts' a piece for the current player. Essentially is a toggle of the div color.

Maybe the check could run pre turn?
Each row can have a counter to keep track of which place gets colored.
on a click the counter would increment and drop in a piece accordingly.

After each turn the whole board needs to be scanned for possible 'connect fours'.

EXTRA!
**maybe there can be a coin toss to decide who goes first?
**maybe they can pick their color on start?
